		<p>
			Hello! It is me, the super cool and very interesting Jae (alias JWBstuhr).<br>
			I am writing this text website because I don't feel like trying to make it look any cooler and I want to make a website.<br>
			I could apply a custom font. Add images. Make sections with different colors.<br>
			Or I could not, the website serves its purpose either way.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>About Me Or Something</h3>
		<br>
		<p>
			Kind of not really but also really sort of notn't well known fact: I'm transgender.<br>
			My pronouns are your choice of she/her or they/them.<br><br>
			In less related information, I'm pretty awful at HMTL/CSS, so.. yeah.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			That's... it. I didn't plan far ahead enough to make more of this website. So, goodbye.
		</p>
